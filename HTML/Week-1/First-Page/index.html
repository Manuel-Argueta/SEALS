        <p>Legos is a great representaion of my creativity. As a child, 
           I played with these blocks for hours on end; always imagining 
           something new that I could build with the blocks. As I got older, I began to migrate the ideas
           that developed while building Legos to different activities. For exmaple, in programming, 
           I see my code editor and my knowledge of different languages as building blocks to
           create anything I can imagine. Besides programming, I like the idea of thinking of my skills or 
           resources as building blocks for anything.

        <p>
          I have been a part of the SEALS program for 2 sessions now and 
          to be honest I have learned quite a bit. Some of the major things that 
          I have learned are the ability to listen and the importance of self awareness &
          honesty. On out first session, we were given the chance to speak with SEAL alumni
          and I learned some valuble information that will help me push thorugh the program.
          Not all has been good though, with self-awarness come honesty and honesty isn't always pretty. 
          Instead of reading The Alchemist, I put it off to do other activities of less importance 
          and realized too late that I had failed to do one of the challenges of the SEALS which was 
          to begin reading The Alchemist. This has changed as I have a have begun reading the novel and plan to 
          it as soon as possible. When it comes to the tech side of things I find teh concpets easy to grasp
          and quite interesting.
