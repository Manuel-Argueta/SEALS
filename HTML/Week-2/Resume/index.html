                    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
                    <p> My name is Manuel Alfredo Argueta and I am a 15
                        year old teenager from South Central Los Angeles.
                        I attend Orthopaedic Medical Magnet High School and 
                        I am currently a sophomore. Both of my parents are
                        of immigrants of Guatemalan nationality and I have one 
                        older sister. I love everything about computers and mathematics.
                        Some of my favorite pastimes are to read and practice my
                        Rubiks Cube algorithms.

                        <h2><u>Future Goals</u></h2>
                        <p>In the future, one of my goals is to attend a university
                           like <b>Stanford</b>, <b>Harvey Mudd</b>, <b>UCLA</b> or even 
                           <b>MIT</b>. I am not entirely sure, but I would like to pursue an education
                           computer science or software engineering. After attaining my education or 
                           during my education, I don't know if I would like to work for a big tech company 
                           like Google or for a start up. In addition, one of my goals is to start my own tech
                           comapny; I dont't know about what yet, but I am sure that inpiriation will come
                           when I least expect it.
