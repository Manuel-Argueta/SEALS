                <br>
                <p>Due to COVID- 19, the Jr. SCLA has transitioned into an online format. Although held through Zoom sessions, students still have the opportunity to be indulged in the environemnt that TXT creates for yound males. A learning environment
                    where you are challenged and questioned at every turn. A place of crittical thinking and leadership development; a place where you are put outside of your comfort zone to make you grow as a person and leader.
                </p>

                <h1><u>My Experience</u></h1>
                <br>
                <p>I have been invlolved with the organization Urban TXT for some time now. My first time being involved with TXT was the SCLA 2020 Summer Program which was also held online. Coming into the program, I did not think that I was going to be
                    challenged the way that I was. I was put in situations that I had never in before; like being in a group with boys I didnt know to build an app and becoming brothers at the end of it. I was taught how to view the world in the eyes
                    of a leader and how to be self sufficient. Jr. SCLA will give you the opportunity to build friendships, computer science skills, social skills, leadership skills, design thinking skill, and the list goes on forever. Personally particpating
                    in one of TXT's programs put me in the right path to discovering one of my passions; computer science. <b>Hopefully, Jr. SCLA can do the same for you.</b>
